# problem #4
# write a program to find if two strings are same.
# two string are considered same if both strings have same letters in same order, but from different starting point
# eg abcd is same as bcda (a is moved to the right)
# abcd is same as cdab 
# abcd is  not same as cdba

# 123456 = 456123
# 123456 not = 412356
# hint - 
# there are many simple answers. you can try with slice function


String_one = input("Enter word one : ")   # asking user to give String 1

String_two = input("Enter the word two (eg: STR 1:abcde , STR 2: bcdea) : ")   # asking user to give String 2

tempWord=String_one   # creating temporary variable to store String one

b = False   # assigning b as false


if(len(String_one)!=len(String_two)):   # if both String has different lenght we can't find the output
    print(f"Both Strings length are not same. String 1 length {len(String_one)} and String 2 length is {len(String_two)}")
    print(exit(0))  # exiting from the program
    
for i in range(1,len(String_one)+1):    # This for loop is to traverse the String 1
    tempStr=tempWord[1:]+tempWord[0]    # each time slicing the string and store it in temp String 
    if(tempStr in String_two):  # checking the sliced String is same as String 2
        print(f"Both Strings are same at {i+1}th time") # if the Strings are same then it is the output
        b=True   # assigning True to b because we found the String to assigning True
        break   # Then don't need to traverse the String to exiting from the loop
    
    tempWord=tempStr    # each time storing the sliced String to the temp word to find next String
    
if(not b):  
    # if my b variable has False then we did't find the String so we need to tell that and 
    #i used not operator to change it as true to print the startement
    print(f"Both String has different characters. String 1 : {String_one} and String 2 : {String_two}")
    
# outputs 

# Enter word one : sayur learning
# Enter the word two (eg: STR 1:abcde , STR 2: bcdea) :  learningsayur
# Both Strings are same at 6th time 

# Enter word one : abcd
# Enter the word two (eg: STR 1:abcde , STR 2: bcdea) : cdab
# Both Strings are same at 3th time

# Enter word one : abcd
# Enter the word two (eg: STR 1:abcde , STR 2: bcdea) : cdba
# Both String has different characters. String 1 : abcd and String 2 : cdba

# Enter word one : abcd
# Enter the word two (eg: STR 1:abcde , STR 2: bcdea) : cdba
# Both String has different characters. String 1 : abcd and String 2 : cdba

# Enter word one : 123456
# Enter the word two (eg: STR 1:abcde , STR 2: bcdea) : 412356
# Both String has different characters. String 1 : 123456 and String 2 : 412356

# Enter word one : krishna
# Enter the word two (eg: STR 1:abcde , STR 2: bcdea) : hnakris
# Both Strings are same at 5th time

# Enter word one : krishna
# Enter the word two (eg: STR 1:abcde , STR 2: bcdea) : shnarik
# Both String has different characters. String 1 : krishna and String 2 : shnarik

# Enter word one : krishna
# Enter the word two (eg: STR 1:abcde , STR 2: bcdea) : jar
# Both Strings length are not same. String 1 length 7 and String 2 length is 3
